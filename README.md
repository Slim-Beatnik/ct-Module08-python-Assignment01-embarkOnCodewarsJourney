Pretty self explanatory:

Do not attempt these Codewars problems until you have completed the previous lessons and feel you have a strong foundation.

Step 1: Watch this resource video for guidance if needed:

Step 2: Complete the following challenges on the Codewars platform. Your solutions must pass all test cases on Codewars before proceeding.

    1. Even or odd - https://www.codewars.com/kata/53da3dbb4a5168369a0000fe    
    2. Convert a Number to a String - https://www.codewars.com/kata/5265326f5fda8eb1160004c8 

    Choose ONE of the following: 
Remove String Spaces - https://www.codewars.com/kata/57eae20f5500ad98e50002c5 
Vowel Count (if you want to try a challenge with loops!) - https://www.codewars.com/kata/54ff3102c1bad923760001f3

Step 3: Once your solutions pass on Codewars, follow these steps:
    1. Open and create a new .py file.
    2. Copy and paste all three solutions into the file, separated by comments that clearly identify each solution.
   
    Example:
    # Solution: Absolute Value of a Number
    def absolute_value(num):
        return num if num >= 0 else -num


    3.Create a to host your assignment:   
    4. Add your .py file to the repository.    
    5. Use Git commands (add, commit, and push) to upload your work to GitHub.    
    6. Submit the here in Google Classroom.
